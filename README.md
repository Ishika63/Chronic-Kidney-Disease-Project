# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Project

This project aims to predict chronic kidney disease based on a dataset collected from a hospital over a period of nearly 2 months. The dataset contains various medical and demographic attributes of patients, as well as indicators of specific medical conditions and test results. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease.
